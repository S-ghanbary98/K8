##### What is Kubernetes

- Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Benefits

- <b>Portability and Flexibility:</b> Virtually works with any type of container runtime. It als works with any type of underlying infrastructure whether public, or private cloud.
- <b>Multi-cloud capability: </b>Kubernetes can host workloads running on a single cloud as well as workloads that are spread across multiple clouds. In addition, Kubernetes can easily scale its environment from one cloud to another.
- <b>Stability: </b>allows you to have rolling updates to change your software without downtime. It is further possible to set up Kubernetes in a way that it supports high availability applications and if you are using the public cloud services of major vendors, you can be pretty sure to reach a very high uptime.
- <b>Load Balancing :</b> Can distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources, with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient.
- <b>Self healing:</b> If failures occur k8 will rectify this by spinning up a new resource to replace the broken one.

## Drawbacks
- <b>Complex: </b>Kubernetes is infamously known for its complexity. Especially for developers not familiar with infrastructure technologies, it can be very hard to get used to the Kubernetes development workflow.
